%\section{Pattern Interface}


%Every pattern that runs on top of the framework should implement the Pattern\_I interface in order to be able to use the services provided by the framework. 
In order to make  certain ``plumbing'' functions easier, functions such as 
registering the pattern with the framework, bootstrapping the communication between the pattern and the framework (depending on the platform and type of deployment), we have defined a  \CPPClassName{PatternBase} helper class.
\CPPClassName{PatternBase} provides a member variable called FRAMEWORK which provides the functions available on the framework side and defines virtual functions that must be implemented by a Pattern, to handle the Events generated by framework. That is, the PatternBase class defines the shim layer for the Patterns and its implementation would vary from platform to platform. 

The chapter describes the \CPPClassName{PatternBase} class  and then explains how to drive from the \CPPClassName{PatternBase} class to implement a full-fledged Pattern use case.
