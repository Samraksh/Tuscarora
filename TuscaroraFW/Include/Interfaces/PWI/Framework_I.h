/**
 * @brief Defines the generic interations between the Pattern and the Framework
 * 
 * Interface class that defines a asynchornous message passing
 * interface for interactions between the Pattern and the framework. A
 * pattern may either be built as part of same process or as seperate
 * process on the same node. When the pattern and the framework are
 * running as two seperate processes, a shim-layer should be
 * implementation that will translate the calls between the two
 * processes.
 *  
 * The interactions in general consist of a command/request orginating
 * from the Pattern to the framework and the framework responding to
 * the commands using an Event response. There are 12 Commands that
 * the pattern can issue to framework and 5 types of Events that the
 * framework sends to the pattern. A command is a message in a
 * specific format (based on a the command being invoked) sent from
 * the pattern to the framework. Event is a message in a specific
 * format sent from the framework to the pattern. While Commands and
 * Events are messages, they are invoked using function syntax, just
 * like invoking and providing functions. To send a command to the
 * framework, a pattern uses a FRAMEWORK reference provided by the
 * shim layer and to handle a event from the framework a pattern
 * implements 4 methods one for each type of event. The shim layer
 * takes care of invoking the correct method when the corresponding
 * event message arrives.
 * 
 * The 4 event types are:
 * 
 * 1. Control Response Event (PTN_ControlResponseEvent_t): This is
 * dispatched in response to one of the *Request message, with an
 * appropriate response type, response status (sucuss/failure), any
 * additional data and its size.
 *
 * 2. Received Message Event (PTN_RcvMessageEvent_t) : This event is
 * dispatched whenever a message is received for the pattern, with the
 * message as the parameter
 *
 * 3. Data Notification Event (PTN_DatNotificationEvent_t): This is
 * dispatched to convey the status of the SendData and BroadcastData
 * calls. The event provides the cummulative status of a message. Each
 * notification contains an array called `statusType' that specifies
 * the status type corresponding to each destination and another
 * boolen array called the `statusValue' that specifies if that
 * operation was a success or failure. For each destination, the
 * status progresses in the following sequence:
 *   PDN_FW_RECV (framework received the packet), 
 *   PDN_WF_RECV (waveform received the packet), 
 *   PDN_WF_SENT (waveform sent the messsage out) and finally
 *   PDN_DST_RECV (destination received the message). 
 * The sequence stops at PDN_WF_SENT for messages sent using
 * BroadcastData api, for which destination received notification is
 * not supported. Also if the status type has progressed to the next
 * in sequence, the previous type is implicitly successfull. For
 * example, for a given destination the status type is 'PDN_WF_SENT',
 * then it also means that PDN_FW_RECV and PDN_WF_RECV are true.
 *
 * 4. Neighbor Update Event (PTN_NeighborUpdateEvent_t): This event is
 * dispatched to provide updates about the status of the nodes
 * neighborhood. A neighbor update can either be about a new neighbor,
 * a dead neighor or change in the quality of an existing neighbor.
 *

   * This is the primary method a pattern uses to request that a
   * message be transmitted to its neighbors.  The first two
   * parameters are self-explanatory.  The third parameter is an array
   * of one or more neighbors to which the message is to be sent, each
   * of which are identified by the neighborâ€™s waveform address. The
   * Framework may use the given MessageId to cancel or replace the
   * payload in future (via calls to the next two methods).  The
   * parameter noDestAck specifies whether a notification is requested
   * when this message has reached its intended destination(s).  A
   * true value for this field means the Framework does not need
   * notifications for this message.  If data
   * notifications/acknowledgements are not supported by the waveform,
   * this parameter may be ignored.
   * 
   * <b>Data Notifications:</b> Framework returns one or more data
   * notification events corresponding to each message sent. The Data
   * Notifications are cummulative in nature. Each notification
   * contains an array called `statusType' that specifies the status
   * type corresponding to each destination and another boolen array
   * called the `statusValue' that specifies if that operation was a
   * success or failure.
   * 
   * <b>Nonce:</b> Nonce is an unsigned integer that the pattern uses
   * to identify the message, before the framework can return a
   * message Id. Framework uses the nonce in the data notification and
   * also returns a Message ID generated by the framework for the
   * message. The nonce need not be unique for every message, but must
   * be different for consequent messages. If two messages have the
   * same once, then the framework assumes that the data notificaiton
   * it sent to the pattern for the previous message is lost and hence
   * the pattern is resending the same message with the same nonce.

   * out. The shim layer will deallocate the message once it has been
   * sent out.
   *
   * @param nonce An unsigned integer specified by the pattern to
   * differentiate this message from previous message. It is used for
   * error recovery between the pattern and the framework.
