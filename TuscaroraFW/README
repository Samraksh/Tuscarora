Samraksh Tuscarora Networking Framework 
=======================================

$TUS is the root directory of the framework

Supported plaforms:
------------------
- Tuscarora is currently supported only on 64-bit linux plaftorms
- The 'standard' platform supported is dce-1.7 on ubuntu-16.04.
- However, most dce versions on any ubuntu higher than 12.04 is expected to work 

Installation:
---------------

The script installs dce, ns3 and configures Tuscarora to run under dce. Please make sure to call the script from the same shell using a '.' in order for environment variables to be set correctly.
cd $TUS/Install;
. ./install.sh

Executing Tuscararo framework modules:
--------------------------------------

The 'runOrDebug.sh' in the root directory is the primary script to execute the modules and tests under framework.
The script cleans, builds, runs and collects the output for the 'test-name' specified 
Run the script without parameters for information on supported options.

Any other way of building and executing requires a deeper knowledge of how Tuscarora is built and compiled. The build enviornment uses CMake and gnu make. Also the binaries are build as shared libraries when run on the 'dce' (ns3-dce) platform and are build as static executable if built for other platforms.

If you are interested in building and running other than using the runOrDebug.sh script get in touch with Samraksh.
