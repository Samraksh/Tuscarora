Changes in version 2.0 (Sept 25, 2016):
--------------------------------------
- Addition of following framework features
	- Piggybacking
	- Timestamping of events and packets
- Redesign of PAL layer modules (most of them) to follow PIMPL design
- Random Number Generator has been generalized and can use an existing generator on a platform.
- Platform configuration introduced through a .h file
- Framework broadcast is disabled by default, a library function called 'RandomSpray' that approximate broadcast over unicast is added to PatternBase
- Out-of-the-box supported patterns: Flooding with Pruning and Gossip 
- Application Writerâ€™s Interface: Two sample applications one using the Flood Pattern and One for Gossip Pattern and being developed mostly as an example for application developers. 
- Generalized Shim layer. This feature envisions a template based general purpose shim library that can be used by any module (Pattern, Application or other external modules) with in built serialization support.
 

Changes in version 1.2 (April 30, 2016):
---------------------------------------
- Samraksh's simulation waveform (a.k.a SLIM) has been enhanced and a new version (v2) added to support
	- Modeling of custom waveforms
	- Flexible specification of error models and FEC ratios
	- Customizable antenna radiation patterns
	- Tests to validate waveform behavior conforms to models specified
- Supports DCE 1.7/ns3.24
- Supports Ubuntu 14.04 through 16.04
- Removed arm toolchains from framework 
- Removed simplewireless sources from repo
- Fixed bugs in waveform acks

Changes in version 1.1 (Dec 31, 2015):
--------------------------------------
- Support for 2 new platforms apart from DCE, a native x86_64 linux and an arm (V1 C2E) linux platforms are supported
- All link metrics implemented
- Link estimation modules can be instantiated at Waveform shims, framework instantiates otherwise
- An address map to convert between waveform native address and Framework node id
- All communication between framework and waveform(shim) uses native waveform address format
- Per-packet link specification of comparator to enable flexible link selection
- Policies for setting number of pending packets per pattern and for overriding link selection to a neighbor
- Framework, Patterns and Waveform can be compiled and deployed as seperate binaries
- A socket based shim layer for supporting multi-process deployment, in addition to direct binding shim for dce
- Implemented a generic serialization/deserialization library
- Added a Bidirectional map data structure
- Support for DCE 1.5
- Moved to a cmake based make environment
