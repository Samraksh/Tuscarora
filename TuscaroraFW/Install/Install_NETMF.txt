Instructions to setup compilation for MicroFramework environment under Windows:

This file uses a stm32-arm target platform as example that Samraksh supports, but the instruction can be adapted for other targets

1. Install CMake for Windows from https://cmake.org/download/

2. Install Visual Studio and associated NETMF SDK.
	- Note:  Make sure you install the version of NETMF SDK that your target supports. In general CMake should be able to work
	with most versions of Visual Studio
	
3. Download a gcc cross compilation toolchain for your target, say from  the target vendor.
	- Note: Support for C++11 is needed
	
4. Create a CMake Toolchain file under TuscaroraFW/Platforms/. See for example Toolchain-Emote-STM32-ARM.cmake file.

5. Generate the Visual studio build files using CMake; CMake will also attempt to build for you.

6. Start CMake-gui
	- Select the TuscaroraFW directory as the source directory
	- Create a 'build' directory under TuscaroraFW and set it as the build directory in cmake
	- Setup the Generator to the version of Visual Studio you installed
	- No need to setup cross compilation: use -Darch="stm32" option and toolchain will be setup for you
	- Run Configure and then Generate
	- Go in the build directory, open Tuscarora.sln in visual studio and build
		- Alterntely use msbuild.exe to build just the appropriate *.vcxproj file.
